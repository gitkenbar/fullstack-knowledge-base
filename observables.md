Understanding Observables
1. Introduction
   In our angular project, an observable is just an object we import from a third-party package RxJS
    observable pattern Observable -> observer
    the observable can have multiple events, or data packages emitted by the observable.

    Observer can:
    1. Handle Data 2. Handle Error 3. Handle Completion
    You, the developer, can control what the Observer does in each of these instances

    similar to call-backs and promises, observables are just a different way to approach them, and have potential advantages.
